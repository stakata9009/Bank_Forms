# Bank_Forms (Bulgarian Interface)
A complete Windows Forms project that has all the checks. It allows registration and login and it is able to send funds from one account to another within the network. It uses JSON file to save all profile info (yes it is not secure).

This form includes the following forms:

Form1 - This is the tsarting form with the following options: Login, Register, Exit;

SignUp - In this form users are able to register. All the necessary checks. No matching usernames are allowed. The project uses a JSON file to read and write all user data (Yes it is not secure). Every new account gets it's own unique 6-digitt ID which users use to transfer funds.

SingIn - From this form users can login with their registrations.

Main - This form is firing once the user has loged in successfully. Here the user can see all his name, account number and funds. On the right side of the form the user can send funds to other users within the network.

Thanks
